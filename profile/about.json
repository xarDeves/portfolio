    "about": "My programming journey began in high school, but the moment I laid my hands on my first computer, I fell in love with tinkering with it. I enjoy diving deep into subjects, while learning how things work under the hood, which i believe is essential for developing reliable and efficient applications.\n\nBeyond programming, I have a strong passion for playing and mixing music, as well as expressing myself through 3D design.",
